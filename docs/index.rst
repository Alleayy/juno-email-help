Introduction
------------

Email interruptions can stem from a variety of technical, configuration, or service-based issues. Whether you're using Juno Webmail or a third-party email application, understanding the underlying causes will help you restore normal email functionality. This Sphinx documentation will guide you through each possible scenario and offer optimization strategies to avoid missing future emails.

Understanding Juno Email Services
---------------------------------

Juno offers two primary forms of email access:

- Juno Webmail: accessible through a web browser from any device
- POP3-based access: for use with email clients like Outlook, Thunderbird, or Apple Mail

Juno does not support IMAP, which means messages are typically downloaded and removed from the server once accessed. This affects how your email is stored, backed up, and synced.

Common Reasons for Missing Juno Emails
--------------------------------------

Incorrect Email Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most common reasons for not receiving Juno emails is incorrect settings in your desktop or mobile email client.

Ensure your email client is configured as follows:

- Incoming mail (POP3): `pop.juno.com`
- Port: `995`, with SSL enabled
- Outgoing mail (SMTP): `smtp.juno.com`
- Port: `465`, with SSL enabled
- Use full Juno email address for login
- SMTP authentication required

An error in server settings can stop new messages from being retrieved or sent.

Spam and Junk Email Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Juno’s spam filtering system is designed to detect and block suspicious emails. However, even legitimate messages may be marked as spam and redirected to the junk folder.

To fix this issue:

- Log into Juno Webmail
- Check the Spam or Junk folders for missing messages
- Mark trusted senders as "Not Spam"
- Add known contacts to your Safe Senders list
- Review spam filter settings for false positives

Mailbox Storage Limit Reached
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Juno email accounts come with limited storage capacity. When your mailbox is full, Juno will reject any incoming email until space is cleared.

Follow these steps:

- Delete emails with large attachments
- Empty your Spam, Trash, and Sent folders
- Save older messages locally
- Regularly monitor your storage capacity through account settings

Email Downloaded to Another Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Juno supports only POP3, emails are usually deleted from the server once downloaded. If you're not receiving emails on your current device, they may have already been accessed elsewhere.

How to prevent this:

- Enable the “Leave a copy on the server” option in your email client
- Check all devices linked to your account
- Switch to Juno Webmail to view emails from any browser

Webmail Interface Glitches
--------------------------

Sometimes the problem lies within the Juno Webmail platform itself, particularly when viewed in a problematic browser.

Recommended actions:

- Clear your browser’s cache and cookies
- Disable extensions that may interfere with JavaScript or security settings
- Use an updated browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Try accessing Juno Webmail in incognito/private mode

Email Blocked or Filtered by Rules
----------------------------------

Juno allows users to set rules that automatically move, delete, or forward emails. These filters, if misconfigured, can cause messages to go missing.

Steps to troubleshoot:

- Go to Juno Webmail Settings
- Navigate to “Message Rules” or “Email Filters”
- Delete or modify any rules affecting delivery
- Ensure messages aren’t being auto-deleted or moved to another folder

Connectivity and Network Errors
-------------------------------

Your device must be connected to the internet to fetch or send emails. Weak signals, timeouts, or ISP issues can delay message delivery.

Suggestions:

- Restart your router or modem
- Use a wired connection for better stability
- Disable VPNs or proxy servers temporarily
- Check your firewall or antivirus for blocked ports

Account Inactivity or Suspension
--------------------------------

Juno may suspend inactive accounts or those flagged for abuse. If your account has been idle for too long, you may stop receiving emails.

Resolution steps:

- Try logging into your Juno account directly
- Reset your password if login fails
- Contact Juno customer support for reactivation
- Regularly log in to your account to avoid deactivation

Outdated Email Client or Software
---------------------------------

Running an outdated email client may result in compatibility issues with Juno servers, especially due to outdated encryption protocols.

To fix this:

- Update your email client to the latest version
- Ensure your device’s operating system is up to date
- Remove and reconfigure the Juno email account

Security Software Conflicts
---------------------------

Firewalls, antivirus programs, or internet security tools can interfere with your email application’s ability to send and receive emails.

What to do:

- Temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall
- Add your email application to the security exception list
- Check for blocked ports (especially 465 and 995)

Incorrect Login Information
---------------------------

An incorrect username or password will result in login failure or sync errors, which may stop new emails from appearing.

Checklist:

- Re-enter your email credentials carefully
- Use the full email address as your username
- Reset your password if unsure
- Avoid multiple failed login attempts to prevent account lockout

Juno Server Downtime or Maintenance
-----------------------------------

At times, Juno may experience outages or scheduled maintenance, preventing message delivery or inbox updates.

Recommended approach:

- Wait and try again later
- Access Webmail from a different device
- Check if others are reporting similar issues on forums or community boards

Email Attachments Too Large
---------------------------

Juno imposes restrictions on email size. If someone tries to send you a large attachment, it may be blocked or returned.

To handle this:

- Ask the sender to compress files or send a smaller attachment
- Suggest using a cloud-based file-sharing service
- Clear inbox space for large incoming files

Comprehensive Troubleshooting Checklist
---------------------------------------

Use this quick-reference checklist to fix Juno email issues:

- Confirm incoming and outgoing server settings
- Double-check your username and password
- Check Spam, Junk, and Trash folders
- Review email rules and filters
- Clear inbox and monitor storage limits
- Update your browser or try a different one
- Disable VPNs or firewall temporarily
- Sync all devices correctly if using POP3
- Use Webmail to cross-check delivery
- Contact Juno support if nothing works

Best Practices for Reliable Juno Email Access
---------------------------------------------

Use Webmail for Flexible Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Juno Webmail is accessible from any browser and doesn’t rely on local storage. Use it frequently for access across devices.

Keep Your Inbox Organized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid reaching your storage limit by deleting old emails and attachments. Regular maintenance ensures better performance.

Use “Leave Messages on Server” Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This POP3 feature helps prevent email loss when using multiple devices by retaining a copy on Juno’s servers.

Update Software Regularly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keep your operating system, browser, and email clients updated to ensure compatibility and avoid service disruption.

Review Filters and Rules Periodically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check your rules and filters to prevent email misrouting. Only enable filters that you actively use.

Log In Frequently to Maintain Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid account suspension by logging in at least once every few weeks. This keeps your account active and avoids loss of service.

Secure Your Account Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose a strong password, avoid public Wi-Fi for email access, and never share login details with unknown parties.
